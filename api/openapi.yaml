        Returns all active and inactive employee profiles in the same format as the #endpoint:wn3pJ3WtCYWuuBL6r endpoint.

        Every client-created custom field (the token bearer has permission to see) will appear as key at the bottom of the profile object.

        As a note, the following fields will always be returned in the API response, regardless of user permissions:

        1. id
        2. email
        3. first_name
        4. last_name
        5. user_status
        6. updated_at
        7. created_at
        8. preferred_name
        9. full_name
        10. job_title


        These will NOT be exposed to the user in the UI if their permissions are set correctly.

        ### Important Note About the Endpoint

        Please ensure you're paginating the response of the GET `/profiles` endpoint to ensure optimal performance avoid possible time-outs.

        **Examples:**
        1. `https://clientname.namely.com/api/v1/profiles.json?page=1&per_page=20&filter[user_status]=active`
        2. `https://clientname.namely.com/api/v1/profiles.json?page=2&per_page=20&filter[user_status]=active`
        3. `https://clientname.namely.com/api/v1/profiles.json?page=3&per_page=20&filter[user_status]=active`

        **Notes:**
        1. If you do not specify the `per_page` value, this will default to 30. The max possible is 50.
        2. If the response returns with less than the number of profiles requested (or none), the `count` in the `meta` object will be 0, and the `profiles` key will return an empty array.

        This endpoint returns a JSON format version of a report created in Namely. These reports update instantly, so each new call to the API will provide the user with updated information.

        After information about the report itself, there is an array of objects that are the columns within the report. The position of the columns is important.

        After the columns is what is technically an array of arrays without any keys. Each "sub"-array represents a line in the report and is a list of values whose position on the list within each "sub"-array sequentially corresponds to the column. For example, if the second "column" is "last name", the second "value" in each "sub"-array is the value.

        The reports API does not technically have a limit to how many lines can be pulled through the API at once. However, we would suggest limiting it to around 200 lines. A user could likely pull more than that without any problems, but they will eventually run into a timeout. There is no hard limit, however.

        Do not have your integration rely on field 'labels' as they are dynamic.  Please use the field 'name' instead.
